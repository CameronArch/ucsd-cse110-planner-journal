# ReminderPopup Component Test Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of each test in the ReminderPopup.test.tsx file. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the ReminderPopup component, ensuring it behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Overview

The ReminderPopup component displays a reminder popup with a title, a close button, and a mute button. The component uses local storage to persist the muted state and listens for a custom 'unmute' event to reset its state.

The tests aim to validate the following behaviors:

- The popup renders correctly when not muted.
- The popup does not render when muted.
- Clicking the mute button hides the popup and sets the muted state.
- Clicking the close button hides the popup temporarily.
- Dispatching the 'unmute' event re-renders the popup.

## Test Environment Setup

Before each test, we clear the localStorage to ensure that tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other. This step is crucial because localStorage persists data across tests unless explicitly cleared, which could lead to inconsistent test results.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Renders the Popup When Not Muted

Purpose: Verify that the ReminderPopup renders correctly when the reminder is not muted.

Explanation:
- Render Component: We render the ReminderPopup component without any initial muted state.
- Assertions:
    - Header Check: Verify that the text "Reminder!" is present.
    - Content Check: Verify that the reminder content "Title goes hereeeeee" is present.
    - Mute Button Check: Verify that the "Mute" button is present.
- Outcome: The test passes if all elements are found, confirming that the popup displays correctly when not muted.

### Test 2: Does Not Render the Popup When Muted

Purpose: Ensure that the ReminderPopup does not render when the reminder is muted.

Explanation:
- Setup:
    - Mute State: We set 'reminderMuted' to 'true' in localStorage to simulate the muted state.
- Render Component: Render the ReminderPopup component after setting the muted state.
- Assertion:
    - Popup Absence Check: Ensure that the "Reminder!" header is not present.
- Outcome: The test passes if the popup does not render, indicating that the component correctly respects the muted state.

### Test 3: Clicking Mute Button Hides the Popup and Sets Muted

Purpose: Test that clicking the "Mute" button hides the popup and updates the muted state in localStorage.

Explanation:
- Render Component: Render the ReminderPopup component.
- Simulate User Action:
    - Find Mute Button: Locate the "Mute" button using getByText.
    - Click Mute Button: Simulate a click event on the mute button.
- Assertions:
    - Popup Disappearance Check: Verify that the popup is no longer in the DOM.
    - LocalStorage Update Check: Confirm that 'reminderMuted' is set to 'true' in localStorage.
- Outcome: The test passes if the popup is hidden and the muted state is correctly stored.

### Test 4: Clicking Close Button Hides the Popup Temporarily

Purpose: Verify that clicking the "Close" button hides the popup temporarily without muting it permanently.

Explanation:
- Render Component: Render the ReminderPopup component.
- Simulate User Action:
    - Find Close Button: Locate the "Close" button using getByRole.
    - Click Close Button: Simulate a click event on the close button.
- Assertions:
    - Popup Disappearance Check: Ensure the popup is no longer displayed.
    - LocalStorage Check: Confirm that 'reminderMuted' remains unset or 'false' in localStorage.
- Outcome: The test passes if the popup hides temporarily and the muted state remains unchanged, allowing the popup to reappear on the next render or page refresh.

### Test 5: Popup Reappears When Unmute Event Is Dispatched

Purpose: Ensure that the popup reappears when the custom 'unmute' event is dispatched, simulating an external unmute action.

Explanation:
- Setup:
    - Muted State: Set 'reminderMuted' to 'true' in localStorage.
- Render Component: Render the ReminderPopup component while in muted state.
- Initial Assertion:
    - Popup Absence Check: Confirm that the popup is not displayed initially.
- Simulate Event:
    - Create Event: Instantiate a new 'unmute' event.
    - Dispatch Event: Emit the event on the window object to trigger the component's event listener.
- Final Assertion:
    - Popup Presence Check: Verify that the popup is now rendered and visible.
- Outcome: The test passes if the popup reappears upon dispatching the 'unmute' event, confirming that the component listens and responds to external events appropriately.
