# Logout Button Tests

## Overview
This document explains the purpose and functionality of the tests implemented for the `LogoutButton` component. These tests ensure that the button correctly interacts with the `AccountContext`, `TaskMenuContext`, and `JournalPageContext` to reset the application's state and call appropriate methods when a user logs out.

---

## Test Purpose
The tests verify the following:
1. **TaskMenuContext Behavior**  
   - Ensures the `setIsOpen` method is called with `false`.
   - Ensures the `setCurrentDate` method is called with `null`.
   - Ensures the `setTasks` method is called with an empty object `{}`.

2. **AccountContext Behavior**  
   - Ensures the `setIsLoggedIn` method is called with `false`.
   - Ensures the `setUsername` and `setPassword` methods are called with `null`.

3. **JournalPageContext Behavior**  
   - Ensures the `setJournalEntries` method is called with an empty object `{}`.

4. **Signout Function**  
   - Verifies that the `signout` function is invoked during the logout process.

---

## Key Assertions
- The `LogoutButton` correctly triggers context methods to reset state values.
- The `signout` function is called to complete the logout process.

---

## Test Methodology
- **Mocking**: Context providers are mocked to simulate component behavior without requiring the full application context.
- **Interaction Testing**: Simulates a user clicking the `Logout` button and observes the resulting interactions with context methods.
- **Assertions**: Validates that all expected context methods are called with the correct arguments.

---

## Conclusion
These tests ensure the `LogoutButton` behaves as expected, resetting the application's state and logging the user out successfully.
