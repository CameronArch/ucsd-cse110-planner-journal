# DayObject Layout Test Documentation

## Overview
This document details the test cases for the CalendarPage component, which verifies the correct rendering of days for each month in both leap and non-leap years.

## Test Environment
- Framework: React
- Testing Libraries: 
  - @testing-library/react
  - @testing-library/jest-dom
- Component Dependencies:
  - MonthChangeContext
  - CalendarPage

## Context Provider Setup
Each test uses a `MockChangeMonthProvider` that provides:
- `currentYear`: Number (2023 or 2024)
- `setCurrentYear`: Mock function
- `currentMonth`: Number (0-11)
- `setCurrentMonth`: Mock function

## Test Cases

### January (Month 0)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

### February (Month 1)
#### Leap Year Test (2024)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-29
- Verification: Checks presence of all 29 day elements

#### Non-Leap Year Test (2023)
- Year: 2023
- Expected Days: 1-28
- Verification: Checks presence of all 28 day elements

### March (Month 2)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

### April (Month 3)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-30
- Verification: Checks presence of all 30 day elements

### May (Month 4)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

### June (Month 5)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-30
- Verification: Checks presence of all 30 day elements

### July (Month 6)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

### August (Month 7)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-30
- Verification: Checks presence of all 30 day elements

### September (Month 8)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-30
- Verification: Checks presence of all 30 day elements

### October (Month 9)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

### November (Month 10)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-30
- Verification: Checks presence of all 30 day elements

### December (Month 11)
- Year: 2024
- Expected Days: 1-31
- Verification: Checks presence of all 31 day elements

## Test Pattern
Each test follows the same structure:
1. Create MockChangeMonthProvider with appropriate month/year
2. Render CalendarPage within provider
3. Verify presence of expected number of day elements

## Special Cases
- February is the only month with different test cases for leap year (29 days) and non-leap year (28 days)
- All other months maintain consistent day counts regardless of year
