# Test Cases for Journal Page Component

This document outlines the test cases for the `JournalPage` component, verifying its key functionalities such as returning to the planner and managing journal entries.

---

## **Test Case 1: Return to Planner Button**

### **Objective:**
To confirm that clicking the "Return to Planner" button calls the appropriate context methods to reset the journal page state.

### **Steps:**
1. Mock the following context methods:
   - `setCurrentDate`
   - `setIsOpen`
2. Provide a mock `JournalPageContext` with the necessary values.
3. Render the `JournalPage` component wrapped in the `JournalPageContext.Provider`.
4. Find the "Return to Planner" button using `getByText`.
5. Simulate a click on the "Return to Planner" button.

### **Expected Result:**
- The "Return to Planner" button is visible on the screen.
- Clicking the button calls:
  - `setCurrentDate(null)`
  - `setIsOpen(false)`

## **Test Case 2: Description Input and Section Creation**

### **Objective:**
To verify that sections can be added, selected, and updated with descriptions in the journal page.

### **Steps:**
1. Mock the following context methods:
   - `setCurrentDate`
   - `setIsOpen`
   - `setJournalEntries`
2. Provide a mock `JournalPageContext` with the necessary values.
3. Render the `JournalPage` component wrapped in the `JournalPageContext.Provider`.
4. Find and click the "+" button to open the "Add Section" form.
5. Fill in the section title input with "Test Section" and click the "Submit" button.
6. Find the new section with the title "Test Section" and click on it.
7. Find the description text area with the placeholder "Write your Test Section entry here...".
8. Enter the description "Test Description" in the text area.

### **Expected Result:**
- The section creation form opens upon clicking the "+" button.
- A new section with the title "Test Section" is created and displayed.
- Clicking the new section opens the description input.
- Entering "Test Description" in the input is reflected in the displayed value.

## **Key Points:**
- The tests ensure that the `JournalPage` component interacts with the context and updates the UI as expected.
- Mock implementations of the context methods verify that the component properly triggers state changes.

---

## **Notes:**
- These tests rely on the `@testing-library/react` library for rendering and interaction simulation.
- Mocked components and context methods allow for isolated unit testing without side effects.
- The `@uiw/react-color` package is mocked to simplify testing for the color picker component.
