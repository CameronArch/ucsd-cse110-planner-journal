# Journal Page Tests

## Overview
This document describes a series of tests for the `JournalPage` component. These tests validate that key features such as font size changes, UI rendering, section management, and navigation between views function as expected. Mocking techniques are used to simulate context values and external dependencies.

---

## Test Cases

### 1. Font Size Functionality
- **Purpose**: Verify that the font size for journal sections can be modified within defined limits.
- **Key Tests**:
  - Ensure font size can be changed and updates the `textarea` style accordingly.
  - Validate that font size cannot be set below the minimum of `11`.
  - Validate that font size cannot exceed the maximum of `25`.

---

### 2. Journal Page Rendering
- **Purpose**: Ensure that the `JournalPage` component correctly renders its core UI elements.
- **Key Assertions**:
  - The page title ("JOURNAL ENTRY") is displayed.
  - The font size adjustment controls ("Notes Text Size:") are present.
  - The navigation button ("Return to Planner") is visible.

---

### 3. Navigation Functionality
- **Purpose**: Test the functionality of the "Return to Planner (Save)" button.
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Clicking the button triggers the `setCurrentDate` method with `null`.
  - Clicking the button triggers the `setIsOpen` method with `false`.

---

### 4. Section Management
- **Purpose**: Validate the functionality for adding and editing journal sections.
- **Key Tests**:
  - Clicking the "+" button opens a form to add a new section.
  - Submitting a new section renders the section title in the UI.
  - Editing the text for a section updates the display value of the input field.

## Mocking Details
### Mocked Contexts
- **`JournalPageContext`**: Provides mock implementations for methods like `setCurrentDate`, `setIsOpen`, and `setJournalEntries`.
- **React-Speech-Recognition**: Mocked to prevent dependencies on real speech recognition during tests.

### Mocked Color Picker
- **Library**: `@uiw/react-color`
- **Implementation**: Simulates a color picker component for testing color-related functionality without relying on the library's actual implementation.

## Conclusion
These tests ensure the `JournalPage` component functions as intended, from user interface rendering to state management. By thoroughly validating the behavior of core features, this suite safeguards against regressions and ensures reliability.
