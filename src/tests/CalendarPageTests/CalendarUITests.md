# Test Cases for Calendar Page Rendering

This document outlines the test cases for verifying the rendering of the `CalendarPage` component. The test ensures that all critical elements, including the title, days of the week, and logout button, are displayed correctly.

## **Test Case 1: Render Calendar Page Component**

### **Objective:**
To verify that the `CalendarPage` component renders all necessary elements, including:
- The planner title.
- The days of the week.
- The logout button.

---

### **Steps:**
1. Render the `CalendarPage` component with a mock `logout` function passed as a prop.
2. Check for the presence of the following elements:
   - The title of the planner (`PLANNER`).
   - Each day of the week: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`.
   - The `Logout` button.

---

### **Expected Results:**
- The planner title (`PLANNER`) is rendered on the screen.
- All seven days of the week are displayed: 
  - `Sunday`
  - `Monday`
  - `Tuesday`
  - `Wednesday`
  - `Thursday`
  - `Friday`
  - `Saturday`
- The `Logout` button is visible and accessible.

---

## **Key Points:**
- This test ensures that the `CalendarPage` component correctly renders the foundational UI elements that form the basis of the planner.
- The inclusion of all days of the week and the logout button ensures the component's core functionality is visually complete.

---

## **Notes:**
- The test uses `@testing-library/react` to render the component and verify the presence of elements using queries like `getByText`.
- The `logout` function is mocked and not invoked in this test since the focus is on rendering verification.
- This test provides confidence that users can see all primary elements when accessing the calendar page.

---

## **Future Enhancements:**
- Add interactivity tests to verify the functionality of the `Logout` button and any other interactive elements.
- Ensure that localization is supported, and days of the week render correctly in different languages (if applicable).
